# Usage

Customers are able to choose "Pay With GloBee" when checking out on Prestashop.
They are then redirected to a payment interstitial, where they can pay for the order using a range of different crypto-
currencies. Once payment has been made, they are redirected back to the Prestashop page, where they can continue shopping.
Both the GloBee System and the Prestashop Order is processed and updated by means of backend systems, to ensure that the
merchant can verify payments and process orders.
